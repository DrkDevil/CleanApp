        <h1>Philosophy</h1>
        <p>Framesworks have been a part of developers, and designers arsenal of tools for a while now, and it's
        no surprise that they are used by millions of developers around the world to get help with jump starting
        their app. But there seems to be a consitant fundemntal flaw with todays Modern Frameworks. Massive Bloat!
        This is increased further after people start writting thier own code ontop of these frameworks while creating thier
        apps, and websites. BonasiApp minimizes bloat with highly organized tag structure utilizing HTML 5 and SCSS to its fullest
		potential.</p>

      <section class="row">
        <h1>Familiarity</h1>
        <p>While creating BonsaiApp we didn't want to fully recrate the wheel. If it's not broke dont fix it, right? While all frameworks
		have their own style of labeling tags. We wanted to make sure you didn't have to </p>

      <section class="row">
        <h1>Variable Design System</h1>
	    <p>Creating themes has never been easier. A premade and searchable SCSS file with every variable precisely named for
	    complete control over your entires apps look and feel through one file. If you want to use BonsaiApps base theme you can
		just download it and start programing. Want to create your own look and feel, we encourage your style everything right out of
	    the variables file itslef. No need for an overwritting theme file or coutless css reset files. Minimize the bloat, and style
		the app your own way and make it yours.</p>

        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <p>GIT, NPM, and BOWER are required to use create an app with BonsaiApp. BonsaiApp is made with beginers in mind, but a
		basic knowledge of Angular is a plus. Design and App making Tutorials will be coming soon. </p>
