            <h1>Donâ€™t Overthink It (Flexbox) Grids</h1>
            <h4><cite>This Article was written by  <a href='https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/'>Chris Coyier</a> of  <a href='https://css-tricks.com'>CSS-TRICKS.COM</a></cite></h4>
            <p>Four years ago I posted <a href="https://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-it-grids/">"Don't Overthink it Grids"</a> and it resonated with quite a few people. Even back then, I thought we might have been at Peak Grid. Someone was promoting a new
              grid framework practically every week. </p>
            <p>That article was my way of saying: "<em>Fear not!</em> You can make a grid yourself! You don't need a complicated framework." It might not have been quite as fancy, but that's how I rolled. You float a couple of elements with some percentage
              widths and call it a day.</p>
            <p>These days, if you are ready to jump to flexbox for layout, DIY grids are even easier.</p>

          <div class="col-12xs">
            <h3>This is how I normally do it:</h3>
            <div class="code-example-box">
              <div class="syntax-hdr-html">HTML</div>
              <div hljs>
                <div class="flex-grid">
                  <div class="col"></div>
                  <div class="col"></div>
                  <div class="col"></div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="code-example-box">
              <div class="syntax-hdr-css">CSS</div>
              <div hljs>

                .flex-grid { display: flex; } .col { flex: 1; }

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12xs">
            <p>That supports any number of columns and they are automatically equal width and flexible!</p>
            <p>Wanna have them break into a column for small screens? Easy:</p>
            <div class="code-example-box">
              <div class="syntax-hdr-css">CSS</div>
              <div hljs>

                @media (max-width: 400px) { .flex-grid { display: block; } }

              </div>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Lets take a Quick Break from the article to include that you can use BonsaiUI's Media Query Mixin to quicly setup your grids breakpoints.</strong></p>
            <div class="code-example-box">
              <div class="syntax-hdr-indigo">SCSS MIXIN <small class="flt-right">(BonsaiUI MQ Mixin using multiple breakpoint.. If so one where inclined)</small></div>

                .flex-grid { @include mq('wide') { display: flex; } @include mq('tablet-wide') { display: block; } }

          <div class="col-12xs">
            <p>Need gutters? You could add margins to the columns. You could add padding to the columns. I like the idea of using justification to create the columns, like:</p>
            <div class="code-example-box">
              <div class="syntax-hdr-html">HTML</div>
              <div hljs>

                .flex-grid-thirds { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; } .flex-grid-thirds .col { width: 32%; }
