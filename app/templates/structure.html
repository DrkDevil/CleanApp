    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content.</p>
    <p>Here's how the BonsaiUI SCSS Grid System works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.</li>
      <li>Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.</li>
      <li>Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.</li>
      <li>Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts. Less mixins can also be used for more semantic layouts.</li>
      <li>Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows.</li>
      <li>The negative margin is why the examples below are outdented. It's so that content within grid columns is lined up with non-grid content.</li>
      <li>Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4.</li>
      <li>If more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, each group of extra columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line.</li>
      <li>Grid classes apply to devices with screen widths greater than or equal to the breakpoint sizes, and override grid classes targeted at smaller devices. Therefore, e.g. applying any .col-md-* class to an element will not only affect its styling on medium devices but also on large devices if a .col-lg-* class is not present.</li>
      <li>Look to the examples for applying these principles to your code.</li>
    </ul>
